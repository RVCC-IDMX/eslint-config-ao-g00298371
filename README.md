# ESLint Configuration
## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The "semi" rule in ESLint checks for the use of semicolons in your code. The recommended setting for this rule is "error", meaning that if you do not include semicolons at the end of your statements, ESLint will raise an error. This rule is important because it helps to ensure that your code will run consistently across different environments. When using source control systems like Git and GitHub, this consistency becomes especially important because multiple developers may be working on the same codebase at the same time, and semicolons (or their absence) can create subtle bugs that are difficult to identify and fix. By requiring semicolons, the "semi" rule helps to ensure that your code will behave predictably, making it easier to maintain and debug.
